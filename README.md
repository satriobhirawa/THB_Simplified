# THB_Simplified
THB project using AWS


First of all, we need to install all the requirements from requirements.txt.
Bare in mind that this project is supposed to be initiated in a virtual environment (in this case we are using pipenv) after we install all the requirements. But, we can also upload it into the AWS as well with small changes in our codes.


NOTE on virtual environment:
- Add secret and access key as os.environ (line 24,25) to your console environment


NOTE on uploading it into AWS:
- Remove debug=True at the end of the code
